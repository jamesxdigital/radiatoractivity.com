> Radiators listen. Radiators create. Radiators simply make us feel better. Radiators positively influence our lives and actions. Positives attract, so if you want more radiators in life, you’ll need to hone your own radiating skills.

> To me it is someone or something that is positive and lifts others up. I try to wake-up every day and say, “Today is a good day”. By starting the day like this, I let the good vibes manifest into being. Even if things don’t go as expected you can always find at least one positive in a day.
