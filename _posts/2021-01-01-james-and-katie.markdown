'Radiator' definition:

> Radiators simply make us feel better. Radiators listen. When we are genuinely listened to we feel respected, valued and good about ourselves. It helps us to express ourselves, often to find out what we actually think or feel. Like tends to attract like so if you want more radiators in life you’ll need to hone your own radiating skills.

'Radiator' definition:

> To me it is someone or something that is positive and lifts others up. I try to wake-up every day and say, “Today is a good day”. By starting the day like this, I let the good vibes manifest into being. Even if things don’t go as expected you can always find at least one positive in a day.
